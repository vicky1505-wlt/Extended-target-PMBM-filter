function [gwd] = GaussianWassersteinDistance(m1,P1,m2,P2)

% Computes the Wasserstein Distance between to Gaussian distributions with
% mean m1 and m2 and covariance P1 and P2.
%
% Can be used as a performance measure for extended target tracking under
% assumed ellipse shapes. Input m1 and m2 as the kinematic vectors (i.e.
% position, velocity, etc.) and input P1 and P2 as the shape matrices.

sqrtP1 = sqrtm(P1);
gwd = norm(m1-m2,2) + trace(P1 + P2 - 2*sqrtm(sqrtP1*P2*sqrtP1));
